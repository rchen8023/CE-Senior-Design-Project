# CE-Senior-Design-Project

This project aims to create and design an independent IoT system allowing users to open and close their household vertical blinds with just a simple tap on their personal mobile phones or tablets. The project requires three parts involving the software, hardware, and mechanical developments. The software aspect involves a web application which allows the user to open or close the blinds as they wish. The web application communicates to the hardware unit via WiFi where the user data is received by the System On Chip (SoC), ESP8266. The ESP8266 can then send out PWM signals to the stepper motor which along with the mechanical design is able to physically move the window blinds. The web application is implemented using HTML and CSS styling uploaded to the ESP8266 web server. The ESP8266 is programmed using the Arduino IDE, and the mechanical design independently sketched and designed using Tinkercad
